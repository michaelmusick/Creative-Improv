# Ecosystemic Improvisation System no. 3

The Ecosystemic Improvisation Environment is a creative improvisation instrument that generates emergent music by exploring connections made in complex, feedback-based systems. This environment adapts techniques of energy relationships and ecosystemic balance from installation compositions of the composer’s Sonic Spaces Project. A performance in this system begins with the composer/performer creating sonic energy through acoustic means. This energy is analyzed by agents in the system, and used by them to live; making their own music. The emergent music of the system’s digital agents and performer is further used as energy by additional digital agents. Unlike the installation based compositions from this project where the system slowly optimizes itself over time, in a performance with this system the composer actively alters not only the output mix of digital agents, but specific properties of these agents as well. This is accomplished through both controllers and the acoustic contributions of the composer.
