# Ecosystemic Improvisation Environment

This is the code base for my _Ecosystemic Improvisation Environment_. This system utilizes SuperCollider and Abelton Live to create a interactive instrument.

This creative improvisation instrument generates emergent music by exploring connections made in complex, feedback-based systems. This environment adapts techniques of energy relationships and ecosystemic balance from installation compositions of the my _Sonic Spaces Project_.
